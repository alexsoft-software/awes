# 24.2.5 [1832]

⏰ 2025-05-10

## NOTE
This version is the last one regarding updates of included applications. Users must now download updates from the official page of each application and manually extract the compressed update files into the corresponding folder inside `[DRIVE]:\AWES\apps\`. The reason is that updates have become large in size, making it impractical to keep them on the server.
